# Double_Linked_Class
This project involved implementing a double linked list data structure with various essential functions. The goal was to enhance understanding of linked lists and their operations.

Key Features:

Insert Node at Beginning: Efficiently adds a new node to the front of the list.
Insert Node After: Allows insertion of a new node after a specified existing node.
Find Node: Searches for a node with a specified value and returns its reference.
Delete Node: Removes a specified node from the list, ensuring proper link updates.
Reverse List: Reverses the order of nodes in the list, modifying the links accordingly.
Get Node: Retrieves a node at a specified index for easy access.
Clear List: Deallocates all nodes in the list, freeing up memory.
Get Node Item: Returns the value of a node at a specified index.
Update Node: Modifies the value of an existing node.
Project Objectives:

Develop a comprehensive understanding of double linked lists.
Implement robust and efficient linked list operations.
Enhance coding skills through practical application of data structures.
